## Data Architecture

The RSS Intelligence Dashboard employs a sophisticated multi-store data architecture designed for both transactional consistency and analytical performance. The system utilizes PostgreSQL as the primary OLTP database, Weaviate for vector operations, and Redis for high-performance caching.

### Data Flow Architecture

```plantuml
@startuml data_flow
!define C4Container

title Data Flow Architecture

rectangle "Data Ingestion Layer" {
    [RSS Sources] as rss
    [API Sources] as apis
    [Email Sources] as email
    [ActivityPub] as activity
}

rectangle "Processing Layer" {
    [Ingest Engine] as ingest
    [Content Processor] as processor
    [ML Pipeline] as ml
    [Vector Pipeline] as vector
}

rectangle "Storage Layer" {
    database "PostgreSQL\n(OLTP)" as postgres {
        [articles]
        [sources]
        [user_events]
        [ml_features]
    }
    
    database "Weaviate\n(Vector)" as weaviate {
        [article_chunks]
        [embeddings]
        [semantic_index]
    }
    
    database "Redis\n(Cache)" as redis {
        [search_cache]
        [session_data]
        [rate_limits]
    }
    
    folder "File Storage" as files {
        [cached_images]
        [documents]
        [static_assets]
    }
}

rectangle "Application Layer" {
    [Search Engine] as search
    [API Gateway] as api
    [Web Application] as web
}

```

### Database Schema Design

The PostgreSQL database follows a normalized design with careful attention to performance optimization through strategic indexing and partitioning.

```plantuml
@startuml database_schema
!define ENTITY entity

title Database Schema - Core Tables

ENTITY articles {
    * id : bigint <<PK>>
    --
    * title : text
    * url : text
    * source : text
    * published_at : timestamp

    * updated_at : timestamp
}

ENTITY sources {

    * type : text
    * config : jsonb
    * last_fetched : timestamp
    * health_status : text

}

ENTITY ingest_jobs {

    * source_id : bigint <<FK>>
    * status : text
    * started_at : timestamp
    * completed_at : timestamp
    * articles_found : integer
    * articles_new : integer
    * error_message : text
}

ENTITY article_chunks {
    * id : bigint <<PK>>
    --
    * article_id : bigint <<FK>>
    * chunk_text : text
    * chunk_order : integer
    * embedding_id : text
    * metadata : jsonb
}

ENTITY user_events {
    * id : bigint <<PK>>
    --
    * user_id : text
    * article_id : bigint <<FK>>
    * event_type : text
    * timestamp : timestamp

@enduml
```

### Vector Database Schema

Weaviate serves as the vector database, storing article embeddings and providing semantic search capabilities.

```plantuml
@startuml weaviate_schema
!define CLASS class

title Weaviate Schema Design

CLASS Article {
    + title: text
    + content: text
    + summary: text
    + url: text
    + source: text
    + published_at: date
    + score: number
    + topics: text[]
    + entities: text[]
    + embedding: vector
    --
    Methods:
    + nearText(query)
    + nearVector(vector)
    + where(filter)
    + group(field)
}

CLASS Chunk {
    + content: text
    + article_id: number
    + chunk_order: number
    + metadata: object
    + embedding: vector
    --
    Methods:
    + nearText(query)
    + nearVector(vector)
    + hasReference(Article)
}

CLASS Topic {
    + name: text
    + description: text
    + keywords: text[]
    + embedding: vector
    --
    Methods:
    + nearText(query)
    + nearVector(vector)
}

Article ||--o{ Chunk : contains
Article }o--o{ Topic : tagged_with

note right of Article : "Primary vector search entity\nwith full article content"
note bottom of Chunk : "Enables fine-grained\nsemantic search"
note left of Topic : "Semantic topic clustering\nfor improved discovery"

```

### Caching Strategy

Redis provides multiple caching layers to optimize performance across different access patterns.

```plantuml
@startuml caching_strategy
!define STORAGE database

title Caching Strategy Overview

STORAGE "L1 Cache\n(Application Memory)" as l1 {
    [Query Results]
    [User Sessions]
    [Configuration]
}

STORAGE "L2 Cache\n(Redis)" as l2 {
    [Search Results]
    [API Responses]
    [Rate Limiting]
    [Session Store]
}

STORAGE "L3 Cache\n(Database Query Cache)" as l3 {
    [Query Plans]
    [Frequent Queries]
    [Materialized Views]
}

STORAGE "CDN/Edge Cache" as cdn {
    [Static Assets]
    [Images]
    [API Responses]
}

rectangle "Cache Policies" {
    note "Time-based TTL:\n- Search: 5 minutes\n- Articles: 1 hour\n- Images: 24 hours\n\nSize-based LRU:\n- Max memory: 2GB\n- Eviction: LRU policy\n\nInvalidation:\n- Write-through for articles\n- Cache-aside for search\n- Manual purge for config" as policies
}

l1 --> l2 : Cache miss
l2 --> l3 : Cache miss
l3 --> cdn : Static resources

## Integration Patterns

The RSS Intelligence Dashboard implements several integration patterns to ensure reliable communication between components and external systems.

### Message Flow Patterns

```plantuml
@startuml message_flow_patterns
!define PARTICIPANT participant

title Message Flow Patterns

PARTICIPANT "External Source" as source
PARTICIPANT "Ingest Engine" as ingest
PARTICIPANT "Message Queue" as queue
PARTICIPANT "Content Processor" as processor
PARTICIPANT "Database" as db
PARTICIPANT "Vector DB" as vector
PARTICIPANT "Cache" as cache

== Content Ingestion Pattern ==
source -> ingest : RSS/API content
activate ingest
ingest -> queue : Publish content event
ingest -> db : Store raw article
ingest --> source : ACK
deactivate ingest

queue -> processor : Consume content event
activate processor
processor -> processor : Extract/Process
processor -> db : Update article
processor -> vector : Store embeddings
processor -> cache : Invalidate cache
processor --> queue : ACK
deactivate processor

== Search Request Pattern ==
PARTICIPANT "User" as user
PARTICIPANT "Web App" as web
PARTICIPANT "API Gateway" as api
PARTICIPANT "Search Engine" as search

user -> web : Search query
web -> api : HTTP request
api -> cache : Check cache
alt Cache hit
    cache -> api : Cached results
else Cache miss
    api -> search : Execute search
    search -> db : Query articles
    search -> vector : Vector search
    search -> api : Search results
    api -> cache : Store results
end
api -> web : HTTP response
web -> user : Display results

== Event Streaming Pattern ==
PARTICIPANT "User Action" as action
PARTICIPANT "Event Tracker" as tracker
PARTICIPANT "Event Stream" as stream
PARTICIPANT "ML Pipeline" as ml

action -> tracker : User interaction
tracker -> stream : Publish event
stream -> ml : Stream processing
ml -> db : Update user profile
ml -> cache : Update recommendations
